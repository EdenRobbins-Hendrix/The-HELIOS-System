  - 'Hopefully you understand how squirrels work now. You should have taken notes
    on what they eat, how quickly they reproduce, etc. '
  - If you continue to observe the squirrels, you may notice that they stop populating
    at a certain point.
  - 'This occurs because the amount of food available to the squirrels is not enough
    to support a greater squirrel population. '
  - Try planting another tree to increase the available food for the squirrel
